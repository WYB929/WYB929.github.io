I am currently a Computer Science M.S. student at NYU Courant. Before that, I receive my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU Courant.<br>
<br>
My research interest is the combination of machine learning and robotics, especially in dataset creation, processing, and ML model design for diverse, multi-modal robot manipulation tasks in both simulation and real world environments. I am currently working with Prof. Lerrel Pinto on transformer based robot learning models and related real world robot experiments.
