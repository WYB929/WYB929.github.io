 I am currently a M.S. student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU Courant.<br>
<br>
My research interest lies in the combination of machine learning and robotics, especially in dataset creation, data processing, ML model design, and real-world experiments for diverse, multi-modal robot manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. I am currently working with Prof. [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com) on transformer-based robot learning models and related real-world robot experiments.
