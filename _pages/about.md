I am currently a Computer Science M.S. student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). Before that, I receive my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU Courant.<br>
<br>
My research interest lays on the combination of machine learning and robotics, especially in dataset creation, data processing, ML model design, and real-world experiments for diverse, multi-modal robot manipulation tasks in both simulation and real world environments. I am currently working with Prof. [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com) on transformer based robot learning models and related real world robot experiments. 

My CV could be found [here](https://wyb929.github.io/files/CV_Yibin_Wang.pdf).
